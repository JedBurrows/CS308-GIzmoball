Tests

Bugs + Cleanup
    Absorber only works dragging from Left to Right, Dragging from Right to left paints Inaccurate gizmo
    Cleanup instances of bad code + MVC breaks
    See todos in intellij
    Absorber gets rotated in model but shouldn't (Useless but would be nice to cleanup) options:
        Use interfaces that differentiate between Rotatable gizmos and NoRotatable gizmos?
        Use abstract classes and split rotate associated methods into 2 classes Rotatable and NonRotatable and have NonRotatable rotate method do nothing?
    May be able to create connections both ways Source > target and target> Source (Need to confirm)
    Right flipper not registering on delete or connect.
